# Personal site

[simonmclean.dev](https://simonmclean.dev)

Built with the following goals and principles

- Clean, semantic HTML
- CSS grid for layout
- Minimal in design
- Easy to maintain
- Statically served
- Highly performant

In future I intend to take the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) approach of having hot-swappable style sheets,
so as to allow theming, without changing any markup or JavaScript. The idea is to build a future-proof site, based on web standards,
such that only the CSS changes when I implment a new design.
